/* 
Final Challenge
Try solving this problem on your own using the two-pointer technique:

ðŸ’¡ Problem:
Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array without using extra space (modify in-place if possible).

Can you solve it efficiently with two pointers? 
*/

/* 
Plan
(1) sort the arrays in place using first
let arr1 = [1, 2] 
let arr2 = [3, 4] 
let pointer1 = 0
let pointer2 = 0


A if right value is greater or equal check if B is
>>>> less than: insert left of A
>>>> greater insert right of A and before

[1, 1, 7], 
 W
[0, 2, 3, 9]
 R
