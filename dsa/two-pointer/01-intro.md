# Lesson: The Two-Pointer Technique in JavaScript

## I. What is the Two-Pointer Technique?

The two-pointer technique is an efficient way to solve problems that involve **searching, sorting, or comparing elements** in an array or string. It usually involves:

1. **Two pointers** moving towards each other or in the same direction.
2. **Reducing the time complexity** from **O(nÂ²) (nested loops)** to **O(n) (single loop)**.

## II. When to Use It

- **Sorted Arrays**: Finding pairs, triplets, or elements that meet a condition.
-  **Reversing Strings or Arrays**: Swapping elements efficiently.
- **Merging Sorted Arrays**: Optimizing operations between two lists.
