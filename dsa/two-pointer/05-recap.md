# Recap

**✅ Two-Pointer Technique Works Best When**:

- The array is **sorted** (but not always required).
- You need to **optimize searching** or **eliminate nested loops**.
- You can solve the problem in **O(n) time** instead of O(n²).

**✅ Different Types of Two-Pointer Approaches**

1. **Opposite Direction (Two Ends → ←)**: Searching pairs, palindrome checks.
2. **Same Direction (One Pointer Lagging Behind)**: Removing duplicates, merging arrays.
