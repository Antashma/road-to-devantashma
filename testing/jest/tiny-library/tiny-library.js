/* 
ðŸŽ© Project: A Tiny Library Utility

Concept: Youâ€™ll create a few small utility functions for a "Mini Library System" and then write tests for them with Jest.

Functions to Implement:

(1) addBook(library, book)
- Adds a book (object with title, author, year) to a library array.
- Returns the updated library.

(2) findBook(library, title)
- Searches for a book by its title.
- Returns the book object if found, or null if not.

(3) removeBook(library, title)
- Removes a book by its title.
- Returns the updated library.

(4) countBooksByAuthor(library, author)
- Counts how many books in the library belong to a given author.

Jest Tests to Write:
- Adding a book increases library length.
- Finding an existing book returns the correct object.
- Finding a non-existent book returns null.
- Removing a book shortens the library and removes the correct one.
- Counting books by an author gives the right number.
