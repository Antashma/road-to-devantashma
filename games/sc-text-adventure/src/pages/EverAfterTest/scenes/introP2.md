#
I take a deep breath.

#
{{playerName}}: (Here I am!)

#
I sat at one of the community center tables in what looked like a large cafeteria. Other people around me chatted but I couldn't focus on any one conversation beside bits and pieces.

#
Voice #1:  ...hoping to get this exam passed...

#
Voice #2: Hah! No way! Same! Are you...

#
Voice #3: Never stick to...consistent...

#
Voice #4: Just need motivation to...

#
{{playerName}}: ... ... ...

#
At least it seemed like I were surrounded by people who were in the same situation.  Even with that, I couldn't help but feel like coming her was a sort of confession of failure. 

#
{{playerName}}: (But not enough to keep me from entering and signing in. I'm present!)

# 
{{playerName}}: ... ... ...

#
{{playerName}}: (Maybe I should just go home...and try this on my own again...)

#
I thought of my past attempts to get a morning routine together. Last time, I had set my clock early for 6am and that failed. Instantly. I just continued to hit snooze until 9am.

#
{{playerName}}: (I probably should have gone to bed earlier first...)

#
As I was thinking of the attempt before that and was frowning deeper, I saw movement near my table.

#
{{playerName}}: (Someone's here.)

#
When I looked up, I saw a young man, maybe my age, who met my gaze with a warm smile. 

#
YOUNG MAN: Hi, I'm Clement. Are you...Samille?

#
{{playerName}}: !

#
::choice: 
{{playerName}}: (Is this...my partner?)
1. "Uh...yes!" -> noact
2. "That's me!" -> noact

#
He grins wider and sits across from me.

#
CLEMENT: Good, I sat at the right table. I'm your partner for this EverAfter Goals program. 

#
{{playerName}}: Oh, nice to meet you, Clement.

#
CLEMENT: Same to you. 

#
I smiled back at his friendly grin for a moment until my face felt warm.  I looked away. 

#
{{playerName}}: (What do I say next?)

#
Before I could think further, I heard Clement start to say something but then he got interrupted by someone on a microphone. We both look in the direction of the small stage and I saw one of the ladies who was originally at the check-in desk waving her arms.

#
CHECK-IN LADY: Hello, everyone! It's time to get started! 

#
CHECK-IN LADY: This first day, we'll just be meeting with your partners. So give a quick intro, let them know what you're trying to achieve in these 4 weeks, and then trade emails. 

#
CHECK-IN LADY: We'll give you guys 20 minutes to get this done and after that, I will come back to let you know what we'll do at the next session.

#
{{playerName}}: (Sounds simple enough.)

#
I turn to Clement who looks at me expectantly. 

#
CLEMENT: You want to go first?

#
::choice
{{playerName}}: ... ... ...
1. "Sure…" -> goto scene:introP2playerStory
2. "Uh, how about you?" -> goto scene:introP2clementStory
