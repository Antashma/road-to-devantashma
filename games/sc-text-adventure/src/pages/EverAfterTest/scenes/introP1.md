{{playerName}}: (I have a goal that's been nagging me for the past couple of weeks.)

#
{{playerName}}: (I know I can do it and I've tried a few times but...I just need some push and accountability.)

#
So, it seemed liked a lucky coincidence when I noticed a flyer pinned to the community board at the grocery store today:

#
EverAfter Goals! Got a habit you want to make? A plan you need to execute? Join us to reach your goals! Get matched with a partner to get a goal done in 4 weeks! Apply today!

#
There was an website to the community center at the bottom and I quickly plugged it into my phone's web browser.  It only took me a minute to fill out the short form. 

#
Hitting the submit button and getting notified of the email confirming my commitment made me feel confident.  

#
::choice
{{playerName}}: Finally. I'll get some needed help on my goal to...
1. Create a morning routine -> store playerGoal
2. Exercise regularly -> store playerGoal
3. Study regularly -> store playerGoal

#
I take a deep breath and smile. Doubts and whatever restrictions seemed to melt away just a little.  

#
Then I remembered that part about being matched with a partner.

#
::choice
{{playerName}}: (What will they be like?  I  hope I'm matched with someone who's...)
1. An insightful mentor -> store playerPartner
2. An encouraging rival -> store playerPartner
3. A cozy friend -> store playerPartner

#
I nod. Someone like that will definitely push me to stay on track for 4 weeks.  

#
{{playerName}}: (At least...I hope so.  And I have to do my best to do the same for them!)

::choice
{{playerName}}: ... ... ...
